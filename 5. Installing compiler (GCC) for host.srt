00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,300
So, in this lecture let's understand installation of GNU Compiler Collections for host.
1

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,210
That means, we are going to install the GCC compiler for host.
2

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,730
So, note that the STM32CubeIDE which we installed in the previous video is an integrated development
3

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:25,420
environment software to develop, compile, and debug embedded applications for STM32 microcontrollers.
4

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,860
So, the STM32CubeIDE installation procedure which we carried out in the previous video, also
5

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,790
installed the GCC cross compiler for ARM Cortex Mx processors.
6

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,510
So, you need not to download any external cross compilers. It is already done. In this course,
7

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,120
we are using a same IDE, to write and compile 'C' programs for our host machine. 
8

9
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,890
That is Windows, Linux, and Mac machines.
9

10
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:57,190
So now we need to install the compiler for our host machine, which doesn't come with the  
10

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,150
STM32CubeIDE installation. So, that we are going to do now.
11

12
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:07,370
If you are using Linux or Mac, then it is very simple you just have to run few commands in order to install
12

13
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,700
the GCC compiler for your host.
13

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:17,510
So that I am going to cover later, but in the next lecture I'm going to cover how to install GCC for your
14

15
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,530
Windows machine.
15

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,750
It is not that straightforward because, we use GCC in windows through a tool called MinGW. MinGW stands
16

17
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,280
for Minimalist GNU tools for Windows.
17

18
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,190
So, it is actually the windows flavor of GNU tools.
18

19
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,530
So, in the next lecture I'll be covering how to install MinGW on your Windows machine,
19

20
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,810
so if you are reusing Linux or Mac machines, please skip the next video.
