00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,930
So, in this lecture let's understand about Installing an Integrated Development Environment.
1

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:14,130
So, in short we call it as IDE. IDE is a software that contains all the essential tools to develop,
2

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,230
compile, link, and debug your code.
3

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,900
In some cases, you may have to integrate compiler and debugger tools to the IDE manually.
4

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:33,000
So, throughout this course we will be using Eclipse-based STM32CubeIDE which is developed by ST Microelectronics
5

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,400
to write, compile, debug
6

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,180
your embedded system applications on STM32 ARM-based microcontrollers. STM32Cube
7

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,060
IDE is an Eclipse-based IDE with STM32 related customization.
8

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,700
Let's see how to download STM32CubeIDE.
9

10
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,600
So, first of all you have to visit this link. So, this link is given in the resource section of this lecture.
10

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,740
So, once you go to this link so you will find Get Software section. There you can download the software
11

12
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,540
according to your machine.
12

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:14,040
So in my case, I'm using Windows based machine, so I'll be downloading Windows software. And select the
13

14
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,720
version here.
14

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,400
You can select the newer version which is available and then click on Get Software. Once you click on
15

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,470
Get Software
16

17
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:30,920
it will take you to the download page. And here you either have to register or if you don't want to register,
17

18
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,840
then you can download the software by simply providing your name and email address in this form.
18

19
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,230
So, go ahead and download this software and I'll see you in the next lecture.
