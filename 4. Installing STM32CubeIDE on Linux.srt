1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:00,650
All right. 
1

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,380
So now let's extract this. OK.
2

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:11,540
So, now you have to go under this folder and this is the installation script which we have to run now.
3

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:11,800
OK.
4

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,060
So, for that let's go to the command prompt.
5

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,580
I'm in that directory, and just do ls.
6

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:16,930
OK.
7

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,420
And let's go under this directory.
8

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:22,820
All right.
9

10
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:23,710
All right.
10

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,200
Now let's do ls. And we have to now give executable permission to this script. 
11

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,480
OK.
12

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,020
For that, we have to run sudo chmod +x. OK.
13

14
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,480
and the file name.
14

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,000
All right.
15

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,120
Press Enter.
16

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,940
Great.
17

18
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:48,500
So, now let's run by using sudo ./ and the file name.
18

19
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:49,610
Right?
19

20
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,060
So, now it is getting installed.
20

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:01:00,370
So, please be patient.
21

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:00,960
All right.
22

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,300
So now you have to accept the license agreement,
23

24
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,250
just press space key and type
24

25
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,800
y. Right?
25

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:17,560
So and then press enter and the license will be accepted.
26

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:17,880
All right.
27

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,890
So now just be patient,
28

29
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,340
there you go.
29

30
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,550
The installation was successful.
30

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,850
Now let's go to the search box and let's search for ST
31

32
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,430
and here it is.
32

33
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:34,820
OK.
33

34
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:42,810
You can launch this application now. All right. And here it is.
34

35
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,260
So, it is asking for you to open the workspace and we are not going to open any workspace
35

36
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,060
as of now.
36

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,980
OK.
37

38
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,470
And we can just press Cancel here.
38

39
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:52,830
Great.
39

40
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:59,010
So, now you just installed the STM32CubeIDE on your Ubuntu machine.
40

41
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,680
Okay.
41

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,380
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
