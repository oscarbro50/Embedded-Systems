Let's look at 'C' programming standardization and will also look at some history of 'C' programming language.
1

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:13,700
The 'C' Programming language was initially developed in AT&T labs by Professor Brian Kernighan and Dennis
2

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,210
Ritchie, known as K&R C.
3

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,400
So, during the year 1970, 'C' programming became very much popular
4

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:27,780
but without any serious standardization to the language. The non-official standard was called K&R
5

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,520
C, which led to many ambiguities among different compiler programmers,
6

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,580
and that actually led to non-portable codes.
7

8
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:43,950
K&R C was a first non-official 'C' standard. So, in 1989 American National Standards Institute(ANSI)  
8

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,750
designed and approved first official 'C' standard, which is also denoted by this tag name.
9

10
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:56,410
And in 1990 it was approved by ISO as international standard for 'C' programming language.
10

11
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:03,310
So the ISO tag name is this one. So, that means the first official international standard was released
11

12
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,520
by ISO in 1990.
12

13
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:15,830
So that's why, it is also called as ANSI C or C89 or C90 standard.So, the language underwent few more
13

14
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:24,020
changes (like addition of new features, addition of new syntaxes, data types etc.) and newly updated
14

15
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,480
standard was released in 1999 under the ISO tag
15

16
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:39,010
this one, which is also called C99 standard in short. So, in December 2011 ISO released new
16

17
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:46,430
standard under this tag name, which is also called as 
C11 standard. C11 supersedes the C99
17

18
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,610
standard.
18

19
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,350
So now in this course, we will be using the C11 standard which is actually compiler default with
19

20
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,600
some compiler extensions.
20

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,210
So, collectively we call it as a gnu11. So more on this, we'll see later. How to change the compiler
21

22
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,270
settings to mention the 'C' standard?
22

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,430
So, we'll cover this later.
23

24
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:13,450
So, note that if you have written a code using C90 standard, then it will compile without any issues
24

25
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,480
in C99 standard compilation, so that what we call is backward compatibility.
25

26
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,050
So but if you have written code using C99 standard specific features, then it may not compile
26

27
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,090
successfully in C90 compilation. So, you should keep this in mind. 
27

28
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,410
But don't worry about this, so we'll see how to set the standard in the compiler later. From the next
28

29
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,190
lecture onwards
29

30
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,130
let's get started with programming.
30

31
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,830
So, let's start with the Hello world program and I'll see you in the next lecture.
