Let's see some of the features of this STM32CubeIDE. In this web page they have listed
1

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,860
some of the key features of this IDE.
2

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,890
Let's understand what are the features which are important to us.
3

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,490
The very important thing is, it supports all the OS platforms.
4

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:17,880
Why?
5

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,040
Because, it is based on Eclipse.
6

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,820
That's why, Multi-OS support.
7

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,790
So that's the good news.
8

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:30,600
And the next important thing is, it comes with inbuilt cross compilers and debuggers.
9

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,300
You need not to download any external compilers or debuggers to integrate that with this IDE. So,
10

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,020
everything comes in one single bundle.
11

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:49,110
So, this IDE actually uses a GNU based C C++ compiler for ARM embedded processors.It has a several other
12

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,830
features like importing projects from Atollic, TrueSTUDIO, and System Workbench. And also in this IDE
13

14
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:03,260
you find some of the advanced debug features including SWV, which stands for a System analysis and real
14

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,780
time tracing which we will be using in this course. And I'll be explaining how to use SWV in the later part
15

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,250
of the course, and also of course you can
16

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:20,160
observe all the CPU core registers, IP registers, and also you can browse various memory locations of the
17

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,000
microcontroller a while you debug the code. So, everything will be covered in this course.
18

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:34,040
And another important feature of this IDE is it has inbuilt support for STM32CubeMX.
19

20
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,870
Now earlier we used to install a separate STM32CubeMX software and then we used to generate
20

21
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,440
the code
21

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,640
and after that we used to import that project into the eclipse software.
22

23
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,630
But with the release of this IDE that is not required.
23

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,020
So, it gives inbuilt support for 
24

25
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:59,810
STM32CubeMX a for peripheral configuration and code generation, but this feature that is integrated  
25

26
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,590
STM32CubeMX feature will not be used in this course.
26

27
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,630
So, you should remember that will not be using STM32CubeMX.
