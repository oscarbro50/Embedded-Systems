00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,180
Alright. Now let's understand what exactly is a computer program.
1

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:12,390
A program is a series of instructions that cause a computer or a microcontroller to perform a particular
2

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,540
task. A computer program includes more than just instructions.
3

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:25,830
It also contains data and various memory addresses on which the instructions work to perform a specific
4

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,670
task.
5

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,480
Now, let's look at different programming languages which we use in embedded systems design.
6

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,790
So, to write a program we have to use programming language, isn't it?
7

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:45,300
Note that, if your goal is to become an embedded system programmer, then you must be good at C or C++
8

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,600
programming languages or both.
9

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:54,510
Nowadays, a rust programming language also has quickly gained popularity and also becoming very much
10

11
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,890
famous in embedded programming.
11

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,120
C, C++, Rust, Assembly,
12

13
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,310
so these are the main programming languages which are being used in embedded systems.
13

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,660
The usage of Python, Micro Python, and Java are also rarely used in embedded systems code development.
14

15
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,790
Assembly level programming is very much powerful and it is still being used in various parts of the
15

16
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,960
embedded project.
16

17
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:26,030
So, it's not like you know a C and C++ have completely taken over the assembly level programming. A still
17

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,370
some part of the project is coded in assembly level programming.
18

19
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,450
Now, if you look at the survey of 2017 made by Embedded.com,
19

20
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,680
so here is a screenshot of Dan Saks presentation during the keynotes speech.
20

21
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,120
So, this video you can find on you tube. So, very much informative video you should watch it on YouTube.
21

22
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,280
If you look at this slide, you can see that 'C' is still the number 1 and highly favored programming
22

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:59,630
language for embedded systems followed by C++ and assembly. But you can also notice that usage of 'C'
23

24
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:06,800
may be declining. So, in future C++ and Rust programming languages also have the potential to gain
24

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,800
significant popularity in embedded systems programming. But still 'C' leads in embedded domain.
25

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,980
It is one of the most powerful high level programming languages to write programs for embedded systems.
26

27
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,740
So, you can download this survey as a PDF
27

28
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,990
if you want from Embedded.com website.
28

29
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,540
Alright. So, that gives us a motivation why we should learn 'C' programming language, because it is still
29

30
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,800
one of the leading programming languages for embedded systems.
30

31
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,200
Now let's get started with exploring the 'C' programming language.
